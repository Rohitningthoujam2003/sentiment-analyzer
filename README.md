"SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF CUSTOMER REVIEWS USING MACHINE LEARNING"
Sentiment analysis is a key task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to determine the sentiment expressed in textual data. This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews from Amazon's Musical Instruments category, with the goal of classifying them as either positive or negative.

The dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps, including text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using techniques such as TF-IDF. Various machine learning models are evaluated, with Logistic Regression achieving the highest accuracy through 10-fold cross-validation.

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning for sentiment classification and offers valuable insights into customer opinions. These insights can help businesses enhance their product offerings and improve customer experiences.
